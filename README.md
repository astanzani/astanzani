- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arnaldo Stanzani,

I'm a professional software developer with experience building fullstack web applications.

Thecnologies I'm working with or have worked with in the past includes, but are not limited to:
- NodeJS and Java when building REST and / or Graphql apis
- React and React Native when building web, desktop or mobile applications
- SQL and NoSQL databases such as PostgreSQL and mongoDB, for data storage

I believe testing should be an integral part of development and should *not* be handled as an afterthought.
I have experience writing unit, integration and end-to-end tests with tools such as Jest and Cypress.

I also believe in using the right tool for the job and am always open to learn new things that might be of use.
I have experience working with cloud services (mostly AWS), using them to provide capabilities to applications, for example:
- Authentication and authorization
- Static storage
- Databases
 
 
Here you may find repos for a few side projects I've worked on on my spare time, mostly for learning and staying up to date with technology.
